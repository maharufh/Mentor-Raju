                    knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                    orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                    the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt </p>

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's
                        most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of
                        China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain
                        for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by
                        followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[9]
                        
                        The Aztecs had schools for the noble youths called Calmecac where they would receive rigorous religious
                        and military training. The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an
                        equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli.</p>

                        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                            intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                            Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                            European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences
                            spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other
                            civilizations – as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
                            knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's
                            Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment
                            saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western
                            and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education system.[17]</p>

                                In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all
                                children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                                education than in all of human history thus far.[18]</p>
